# monster-fighter
A simple monster fighting game.

The goal is to kill 1 out of 3 randomly generated monsters, level up and collect gold.  
After killing a monster, you may stumble upon a magical potion, that could either help you become stronger or weaken you.

You win by reaching level 20, and collecting as much gold as you can.

The game is heavily RNG-based, and may require you to try multiple times before finally getting to the end!
